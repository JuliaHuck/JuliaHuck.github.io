# About

I am a neuroscientist with a strong background in quantitative vascular neuroimaging and a growing interest in the influence of hormones on brain health. My work bridges structural and physiological brain imaging to understand how vascular health contributes to cognitive aging and brain vulnerability. I specialize in advanced MRI methods, multimodal data integration, and the development of neuroimaging tools to investigate brain oxygenation, perfusion, and vascular anatomy.

I completed my PhD in the Department of Physics at Concordia University, with a research focus in Neuroscience under the supervision of Dr. Claudine Gauthier. My doctoral research centered on the venous vasculature of the human brain using high-field 7T MRI. I developed the [VENAT atlas](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/VENAT_Probability_map_nii_gz/7205960) ([Huck J, et al., Brain Struct Funct. 2019](10.1007/s00429-019-01919-4)), a population-based atlas of the cerebral veins, and later investigated how venous anatomy influences BOLD signal interpretation ([Huck J, et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26431)). I also used susceptibility-weighted imaging and ASL to study oxygen metabolism in cognitively healthy individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

I am currently completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the Université de Sherbrooke in the lab of Dr. Kevin Whittingstall. My work spans multiple projects focused on cerebrovascular health and brain aging. I recently published a study validating our software for the automatic detection and diameter estimation of arteries in the Circle of Willis, demonstrating its accuracy relative to expert manual measurements ([Huck J, et al. JCBFM, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X251338972)). In a related project, I am investigating how white matter hyperintensities (WMH) relate to vascular borderzones in healthy aging. In parallel, I am leading a study examining sex differences in individuals with cerebral arterial stenosis, with a focus on associated brain volume changes. These projects build on my background in image processing, vascular physiology, and neuroimaging, while expanding my expertise in machine learning, pipeline development, and sex-based analysis in cerebrovascular research.

While my foundation is in neurovascular imaging, my research interests are shifting toward understanding how hormonal transitions—such as those occurring during pregnancy, menopause, and in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—influence vascular and cognitive outcomes. Although I am not directly involved in ongoing hormonal research projects in my current lab, this environment has greatly shaped my scientific perspective. As someone living with PCOS, I am deeply aware of the limited research on women’s brain health and am committed to contributing to a more inclusive, representative, and equitable scientific landscape.

My long-term goal is to establish an interdisciplinary research program that combines neuroimaging, vascular health, and hormonal influences to better understand individual trajectories of brain aging. Through collaboration, innovation, and mentorship, I aim to help advance early detection strategies and preventative approaches in cognitive and brain health.
