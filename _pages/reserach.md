## âœ… Completed Projects

### ðŸŽ“ Postdoc Projects
- **Artery Segmentation Validation** (2023â€“2025) 

### ðŸŽ“ PhD Projects
- **VENAT Atlas** â€“ A population-based venous atlas using 7T MRI  
- **Venous Effects on BOLD** â€“ Investigating venous anatomy's influence on fMRI signal   
- **Oxygen Metabolism in APOE Îµ4 Carriers** â€“ Combined ASL and susceptibility-based imaging 

## ðŸ§² MRI Techniques Used
- **QSM (Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping)** 
  For mapping venous anatomy and estimating tissue magnetic susceptibility. Also used for estimating oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in veins and assessing iron accumulation in the basal ganglia.

- **SWI (Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging)**  
  For visualizing venous vasculature and microbleeds.

- **ASL (Arterial Spin Labeling)**  
  For non-invasive measurement of cerebral blood flow.

- **T1- and T2-weighted imaging**  
  For structural analysis and segmentation.

- **TOF-MRA (Time-of-Flight Angiography)**  
  For imaging cerebral arteries and stenoses.

- **BOLD fMRI**  
  For exploring blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes in relation to venous anatomy.
